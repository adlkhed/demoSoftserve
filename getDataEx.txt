        "Description": "An eye movement-based methodology and assessment tool may be used to     quantify many aspects of human dynamic visual processing using a     relatively simple and short oculomotor task, noninvasive video-based eye     tracking, and validated oculometric analysis techniques. By examining the     eye movement responses to a task including a radially-organized     appropriately randomized sequence of Rashbass-like step-ramp     pursuit-tracking trials, distinct performance measurements may be     generated that may be associated with, for example, pursuit initiation     (e.g., latency and open-loop pursuit acceleration), steady-state tracking     (e.g., gain, catch-up saccade amplitude, and the proportion of the     steady-state response consisting of smooth movement), direction tuning     (e.g., oblique effect amplitude, horizontal-vertical asymmetry, and     direction noise), and speed tuning (e.g., speed responsiveness and     noise). This quantitative approach may provide fast and results (e.g., a     multi-dimensional set of oculometrics and a single scalar impairment     index) that can be interpreted by one without a high degree of scientific     sophistication or extensive training.",

        "Description": "Dynamic visual processing remains difficult to assess clinically, due at least in part to the lack of a readily-available assessment tool and a codified set of performance standards.  Severe impairments in dynamic visual function can stem from a large number of causes, including: stroke, traumatic brain injury, autism, Alzheimers disease, schizophrenia, degenerative retinal disease, drug toxicity, aging, and spaceflight-induced visual impairment.  To assess various aspects of dynamic visual function including peripheral attention, peripheral spatial localization, perceptual motion processing, and oculomotor responsiveness, we developed a simple fifteen-minute clinical test that measures and computes ten eye-movement-based, i.e., oculometric, measures.  Our oculometric tool may be useful to clinicians to localize affected brain regions following trauma, degenerative disease, or aging, to characterize and quantify clinical deficits, to monitor recovery of function after injury, and to detect altered or impaired visual performance at sub-clinical levels.  This sensitive assessment tool has immediate applicability as a screening tool by comparing the oculometric measures of an individual to a normal baseline population, or from the same individual before and after exposure to a potentially-traumatic event (e.g., a boxing match, football game, combat tour, space mission), or on an ongoing basis to monitor performance as it returns to baseline following injury.  Applications of our oculometric tool include screening: patients for deficits in visual function; pilot candidates based upon inherent dynamic visual capabilities; patients, players, or soldiers for recovery by periodic reassessment following injury;  automobile drivers as they age; and astronaut visual status before and after a mission.",

Prior compact, cylindrical antennas designed for therapeutic localized hyperthermia do not exhibit such directionality: that is, they radiate in approximately axisymmetric patterns. Prior directional antennas designed for the same purpose have been, variously, (1) too large to fit within catheters or (2) too large, after deployment from catheters, to fit within the confines of most human organs. In contrast, the present antenna offers a high degree of directionality and is compact enough to be useable as a catheter in some applications.",

In operation, a cooled cryogen is pumped through the upstream cold box into the pipe being tested.

A precise measurement of the rate of heat leak into the process fluid is needed in this process. The technology operates on the theory that the heat leak is equal to the boiloff rate multiplied by the latent heat of vaporization. A heat leak rate is computed while maintaining the temperature of the cold boxes at the end of the pipe and measuring the boiloff rate. Thermally isolated valves, plumbing, and safety devices within the cold boxes allow for convenient and efficient controls and a repeatable procedure. All test measurements are recorded on a field-polaptop computer.",

It is a fine pointing capability for laser beam pointing to augment body pointing by CubeSats in Low Orbit Earth (LEO).  It is simple, static and compact.  It combines a small lens system and a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL)/Photodetector Array in a novel way for laser beam pointing.  Body pointing was used earlier for CubeSats in LEO in NASA's Optical Communications and Sensors Demonstration (OCSD) program [1]. This fine pointing capability was computer simulated for the CubeSats used in the OCSD program [2,3]. With fine pointing, the spot size on the Earth was reduced by a factor of eight with a reduction in laser output power by a factor of sixty-four, thereby mitigating the thermal load challenge on the OCSD CubeSats.",

While this may be sufficient for an indirect and relative assessment, the image sharpness of the exterior edge may be not representative of interior boundaries and only serves as an indirect measure.

Dielectric waveguides&#8212;long, solid pieces of dielectric that confine electromagnetic waves&#8212;offer high bandwidth and low transmission loss compared to conventional metallic waveguides. Despite these advantages, practical use of these waveguides has been limited because a large fraction of signal power is lost at the state-of-the-art interconnects joining conventional metallic waveguides and dielectric waveguides. JPL's interconnect solution uses lens coupling to reduce these losses by a factor of 10 or more, yielding a reliable, cost-effective alternative to conventional waveguides.",

While the outstanding long-term stability of ground-based mercury ion clocks has attracted significant interest, conventional plasma discharge lamps limit the short-term stability of the clock because they do not output sufficient ultraviolet (UV) light. In the HCPCF lamp, plasma is generated along the length of the fiber and excited by a coil, producing UV light. The longer the fiber, the more light is generated; this increases the clock signal-to-noise ratio and leads to an improvement in clock short-term stability. Unlike conventional plasma discharge lamps, HCPCF lamps are mass-producible, meaning that they can be fabricated in a repeatable manner that allows for standardization of these optical sources.",

While state-of-the-art systems use flexible braided copper heat straps to thermally link cryocoolers with cryogenic systems, these straps cannot be made short enough and flexible enough for use in larger systems requiring more than 50 W of heat extraction. If the heat strap is not flexible enough, thermal contraction will break the cryocooler; if the heat strap is not short enough, its thermal resistance will be too high to extract the required heat.

Typically, blackbody targets are formed via additive processes (e.g., high-emissivity paint, carbon nanotubes).  JPL's innovation utilizes highly doped black silicon formed via inductively coupled plasma (ICP) etching at cryogenic temperatures (i.e., a subtractive process), providing an ultrahigh emissivity surface. This rapid and cost-effective technique yields a uniform etched surface with extremely low reflectivity of visible and infrared (IR) radiation and near-zero transmission, resulting in a high-emissivity surface. Specifically, total emissivity is greater than 99.5 percent for wavelengths between 400 nm and 2,500 nm. This high level of light absorption is possible thanks to the needle-like nanotips (1- to 150-&micro;m long and 0.3- to 5-&micro;m wide, depending upon the parameters utilized) etched into a highly absorbing doped silicon substrate. This dense \"forest\" (typically ~10<sup>6</sup> needles/mm<sup>2</sup>) is completely inorganic. Furthermore, because it is formed by a subtractive process, it does not flake off.",

This fully electric vehicle is well-suited for busy urban environments, industrial complexes, or large resort areas. The MRV combines a number of innovative technologies that are available for licensing as a whole system or individually as components. The MRV has no mechanical connections to the propulsion, steering, or brake actuators-- instead the driver relies on control inputs being converted to electrical signals and transmitted by wire to the motors within the vehicle. The MRV has a fully redundant, fail-operational architecture that is paramount to the safe operation of a by-wire system. The MRV is driven by four independent wheel modules, called e-corners. Each e-corner can be rotated +/- 180 degrees about its steering axis.  Imagine being able to parallel park by simply driving sideways into a tight spot with ease. With the new MRV technology, this dream is now a reality.",

The In Situ Wire Damage Detection and Rerouting System consists of a miniaturized inline connector containing self-monitoring electronics that use time domain reflectometry (TDR) to detect wire faults and determine fault type and fault location on powered electrical wiring. When a damaged or defective wire is identified, the system is capable of autonomously transferring electrical power and data connectivity to an alternate wire path. When used in conjunction with NASAs wire constructions that use a conductive detection layer, the system is capable of detecting and limiting damage not only to the core conductor, but also to the insulation layer before the core conductor becomes compromised.",

        "Description": "Currently, the dominant method to generate ultrafast laser pulses passively is the use of semiconductor saturable absorber mirrors (SESAMs). This type of passive mode locker produces exceptional results but is difficult to fabricate, expensive and limited in bandwidth. In contrast, a graphene based saturable absorber is easier to produce and has the advantages of much wider bandwidth, lower saturation intensity, tunable modulation depth, ultrafast recovery time, and much higher optical damage threshold, thus producing higher energies. High energy (10s nJ) and femtosecond pulses with repetition rate on order of 100s MHz have been demonstrated using graphene as a saturable absorber in developing a graphene-based mode-lock device for a laser transmittter. This work has also led to the development of other novel photonics devices.",

The disadvantage of the scanning system is the time it takes to scan, which prevents simultaneous image acquisition. This can be a problem for systems involving moving observers or objects, or both. Diffraction grating systems are also commonly used for three-dimensional imaging. These systems are limited by the grating throughput efficiency, and create difficulty generating a large number of spots and spots with equal energy. Flash LiDAR systems with uniform light distribution are also used, but these systems suffer from adjacent pixel crosstalk, reduced system measurement efficiency and difficulty in giving equal intensity weighting to each pixel. The present innovation overcomes the shortfalls of previously used three-dimensional imaging systems by employing a simple lens system.",

Conventional approaches for absorber coatings are susceptible to aging, which hinders the transient optical efficiency of the instrument. Additionally, conventional absorber coatings have a high heat capacity which impact the performance of low-background cryogenic detectors.

Conventional scintillator-based charged particle counters rely upon a glass photomultiplier tube (PMT) to translate light energy from the radiation source into an electrical signal. Because PMTs are bulky, fragile, and require high voltages to operate, they are not well-suited for harsh environments. Glenn's technology is solid state, thus eliminating PMTs, which means the device can operate in cramped, harsh, and low-power environments. In addition, because the detector uses a low-voltage, UV-sensitive photodiode, a wave shifter is not required, improving efficiency and further minimizing weight and bulk. Originally developed for space exploration, this compact, robust particle counter can also be used in medical dosimetry, mining, oil and gas exploration, nuclear facility monitoring, and more.",

        "Description": "To run at maximum efficiency, turbine engines often experience temperatures of more than 2000 degrees Kelvin, and these elevated temperatures can lead to compromised integrity and failure of the blades. One method for addressing this problem is film cooling, in which cool air is bled from the compressor, ducted to one or more internal chambers of the turbine blades, and discharged through one or more cooling holes to form cooling jets. As a result of the cooling jets, convective heat transfer to the surface of the turbine blade can be reduced. Innovators at NASA's Glenn Research Center have developed two new ways to improve the effectiveness of film cooling. One involves using a shaped recess to create a counter-rotating vortex pair, splitting the incoming flow to a high-energy and a low-energy stream. The other innovation employs various techniques to mitigate the aerodynamic losses that sometime accompany film cooling. These novel approaches make film cooling a much more efficient and successful means of keeping turbine blades operable.",

Painted onto a surface, the coating gradually changes color from a reddish-brown at room temperature to black-gray at 600&deg;C. The color change is reversible and repeatable, as temperature cycles from low to high and back again. The technology greatly improves on conventional photoluminescence techniques, which work only with high-intensity short wavelength light. Because Glenn's innovation works in white light, which is easily produced, color changes can be detected and recorded using low-cost sensors instead of single-point or global-imaging-based detectors. The coating is inexpensive and easy to apply, and it contours to complex shape surfaces. Developed for use in NASA's high-speed aircraft test facilities, the coating also offers exciting new industrial and automotive potential.",

This technology represents the latest evolution of the Spring Tire which was invented by NASA Glenn and Goodyear, and inspired by the Apollo lunar tires.  The novel use of shape memory alloys capable of undergoing high strain as load bearing components, instead of typical elastic materials, results in a tire that can withstand excessive deformation without permanent damage.  Using shape memory alloy as radial stiffening elements can also increase the load carrying capacity of the tire. The Superelastic Tire offers traction equal or superior to conventional pneumatic tires and eliminates both the possibility of puncture failures and running &#34;under-inflated&#34;, thereby improving automobile fuel efficiency and safety.  Also, this tire design does not require an inner frame which both simplifies and lightens the tire/wheel assembly.",

Glenn's technology uses double-fed electric machines and a high-voltage, variable-frequency power system to significantly decrease (by 85%) the weight of an aircraft's power electronics for turbo-electric propulsion, while still providing high specific power and variable thrust. To provide a safe system, the lightweight electric machines operate at high frequency, allowing fast detection and clearance of faults without requiring switchgear that interrupts the current. This design also reduces the protection system's weight, while improving reliability by minimizing fault energy and collateral damage potential. In addition, the system permits either sub-synchronous or super-synchronous operation relative to throttle position, without having to adjust turbine settings.

In contrast, the DELTA convertor enables an order of magnitude improvement in specific power compared to conventional engines. The DELTA convertor harnesses the power of thermoacoustics by relying on the relationship between the temperature and pressure oscillations present in sound waves. By using thermoacoustics to drive a double-action piston, this revolutionary DELTA convertor enables a lightweight, maintenance-free, high specific power system ideal for unmanned aircraft vehicles, next-generation aircraft, mobility on demand, and any power system in which efficiency, size, and weight are critical.",

        "Description": "NASA's Glenn Research Center has developed a novel design for a fully premixed high-pressure burner capable of operating on a variety of gaseous fuels and oxidizers, including hydrogen-air mixtures, with a low pressure drop.  The burner provides a rapidly and uniformly mixed fuel-oxidizer mixture that is suitable for use in a fully-premixed combustion regime that has the benefit of low pollutant emissions.  Further, it is free from harmful flashback effects, combustion instabilities, and thermal meltdown problems that are normally associated with premixed combustion systems operating at high pressures. This burner can be easily scaled for use in practical low-emissions combustion systems such as stationary power plants or hydrogen-air combustion for vehicles. This technology is also applicable to process gas heaters, chemical processing, process gas afterburners, kiln or furnace burners, utility boiler burners, gas reforming burners, and fuel cell processing burners.",

SMAs have a unique ability to effect a reversible phase transformation, so that they can withstand being severely deformed and recovered repeatedly. Glenn's innovation, flown in a successful space mission, uses SMA components in actuators and hinging elements to improve retention, release, and deployment of crucial structures, such as solar arrays. Compared to standard devices, the SMA-based mechanisms are much smaller and lighter, do not produce debris, and require minimal power to operate, meeting the rigorous power budget for CubeSats. These SMA-based components are a key breakthrough for CubeSats and other small satellites, where their small size and weight, reusability, and reliability are mission critical. In addition, these mechanisms can be scaled up, so their benefits can be realized in larger spacecraft as well.",

Glenn's breakthrough EBCs are the only coatings that can withstand such temperatures, protecting CMCs from increased wear and corrosion, oxidation, and water vapor recession in extreme environments. In addition, these EBCs can be fabricated with simpler and lower-cost methods than conventional coating processes such as plasma spraying.

Conventional methods of using discontinuous fiber composites for forming complex shapes can produce defects, including a tendency toward weakness and fatigue at the cut ends of the fibers. Glenn's novel technology instead uses multiple layers of formable continuous fiber composite material, eliminating the cut ends that form a potential site for failure, as well as filler materials between plies. Using this method, manufacturers can provide the optimum shape of the continuous plies and thus of the structure as a whole. The structure can then meet high specific strength and high cycle fatigue resistance requirements for rotorcraft gears and other applications, including aircraft, power generation such as wind turbine systems, unmanned vehicles, and urban air mobility (UAM).

Communication links are subject to atmospheric effects that reduce the signal power received at the antenna (i.e., a fade). If the atmospheric losses are too high, the signal level could drop below the minimum measurable power of the receiver, causing data loss across the communication link. Previous attempts to forewarn fading using predictive algorithms have yielded sub-optimal results largely because they rely on real-time performance data from the communications link itself, meaning they have very little time to respond. By contrast, NASA's VR constantly senses incoming noise, which allows real-time measurement and characterization of fading and enables maximization of data throughput.",

Traditionally, this task is accomplished through the use of a Mach Zehnder Modulator (MZM), a primarily analog component. In order to generate a high-fidelity optical signal, the input electrical signal must be of equally high fidelity, which is a difficult task due to the competing requirements of the digital components and the analog modulator. The digital components required to generate the waveform contain non-idealities which degrade the extinction ratio (ER) of the optical signal. The Cascaded Offset Optical Modulator corrects these non-idealities in the electro-optic subsystem during modulation by relieving the SDR of the extreme fidelity requirements imposed by the optical modulator. This approach is valid in any optical transmission system that requires high fidelity binary pulses without a complex component.",

The drive for energy efficiency in power generation and propulsion places the development of high-performance materials at the forefront of materials science. Turbine engine efficiency and reduction in carbon emissions are directly related to engine operating temperature. With increasing temperatures, materials start to plastically deform under load, a process known as creep, which sets severe limits on performance. Therefore, increased performance in aircraft engines and land-based power generators requires the development of new high-temperature structural materials that are resistant to creep. For example, a main factor prohibiting higher operating temperatures in jet turbine engines is the creep life of the Ni-based superalloy turbine disks. NASA's new superalloy composition significantly improves the creep life of turbine disks and also increases the operating temperature limit.",

The technology allows for variable shape control of aircraft structure through actively deformable surfaces. The flow effectors are made by embedding shape memory alloy actuator material in a composite structure. When thermally actuated, the flow effector deflects into or out of the flow in a prescribed manner to enhance mixing or induce separation for a variety of applications, including aeroacoustic noise reduction, drag reduction, and flight control. NASA developed the active flow effectors for noise reduction as an alternative to fixed-configuration effectors, such as static chevrons, that cannot be optimized for airframe installation effects or variable operating conditions and cannot be retracted for off-design or fail-safe conditions.",

Now NASA scientists have further provided incremental improvement in this technology by creating a recipe and procedure for the inexpensive and simple production of fine-grained targets required for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes using FEL. Previously used targets employed metal powders that did not have a particularly small grain size or small size dispersibility. The targets used here are made of powder forge metals that are both small and dispersible. The targets facilitate a significant cost reduction in the supply of high-quality single-walled carbon nanotubes.",

The objective of TASAR is to improve the process in which pilots request flight path and altitude modifications due to changing flight conditions. Changes may be made to reduce flight time, increase fuel efficiency, or improve some other flight attribute desired by the operator. Currently pilots make such requests to ATC with limited awareness of what is happening around them. Consequently, some of these requests will be denied resulting in no flight improvements and an unnecessary workload increase for both pilots and ATC.

This results in an array that can be considered \"self-matching.\" Beamforming microphone arrays typically consist of tens to hundreds of microphones. The location of an acoustic source can be determined by exploiting the acoustic wave propagation delays from the source to each of the microphones. For the system to be accurate each microphone must be calibrated to account for varying magnitude and phase frequency responses. Manual calibration is time-consuming and may need to be repeated regularly to take into account effects such as heat and humidity. The NASA Langley / MSU innovation removes such time-consuming calibration and provides more accurate results.",

The NASA system offers a benefit based on the fact that the existing electromagnetic methods lack targets at 30,000-40,000 ft and will not detect CAT. Because CAT and severe storms emit infrasound that propagates over vast distances through the Earths atmosphere, the Langley system offers an excellent early warning opportunity.

However, ICP monitoring is complicated by a large set of variables related to the patients themselves -- presented symptoms, circumstances, and related information indicating such measurement; and relevant accompanying issues. These conditions and the various combinations thereof present attending physicians with the choice of many alternatives regarding key parameters, including but not limited to urgency, availability, appropriability, and accuracy to a minimum standard.  Cost, complexity, ease of use and other issues are also meaningful factors, but the bottom line for any of the various technical approaches, whether invasive or non-invasive, is performance.  Key to this technology is its capability to correlate closely with established tympanic membrane displacement (TMD) ICP monitoring technology.",

The blocking groups can be removed by one of several means.   Once deblocked, the resin can be cured in an identical manner to an unmodified resin system.

Additional motivation to use soft goods structures results from the potential for mass savings achievable from three features: (1) the use of very high specific strength filamentary materials; (2) reduced design loads since the design is driven by in-space loads following deployment instead of loads induced during launch, which are typically higher; and (3) reduction in the mass of the launch shroud and launch system due to the compactness of the packaged inflatable structure.",

Batteries meet all but the continuous power requirement. Radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTG) meet the continuous power condition but none of the others.   However, a compact, thermionic-based cell that converts heat to electricity can meet all the above requirements . A tightly spaced array of nanometer-scale emitter points efficiently converts the heat from Plutonium-238 (238 Pu) into usable electricity. The thermionic cell uses metals with low work-function, not semiconductors, and escapes many of the RTG limitations such as lower carrier concentration and mobility, and the difficult requirement of high electrical and low thermal conductivity. It delivers an estimated 10-20% vs. 7% efficiency for an equivalent-sized, 238Pu-based RTG.  Such a power cell would be ideal for remote, hazardous or otherwise isolated applications such as remote sensors/transmitters in severe environments.",

For wind tunnel applications, particle image velocimetry is often used to determine the interaction of various models and surfaces with surrounding airflows.  Measurements near the wall are particularly relevant and unfortunately exceptionally challenging due to the large level of background noise arising from reflection of incident light off the surface of the model being studied.  Thus, the ability to seed the airflow with a material that can be used to accurately portray the airflow properties (i.e., minimal particle lag) while enabling near wall measurements with improved signal to noise ratio is of high interest to wind tunnel researchers.",

Inertial systems suffer from positional drift which currently occurs on the order of minutes for compact systems. GPS suffers from multipath affects near metallic structures (which are ubiquitous in transmission line infrastructure), from satellite loss due to horizon blockage (the stadium effect), from electromagnetic interference on the radio band of GPS transmissions, and, most fundamentally, from loss of the GPS transmission by the orbital satellites.

The Molten Target Sputtering (MTS) method can increase the kinetic energy, the energy latency, and the flux density of sputtered atoms by combining the benefits of both magnetron sputtering and evaporation systems.   It does this by a clever, but simple mechanical modification to the magnetron sputtering gun.  For the MTS method, a simple 1~2mm (depth and width) ring-shaped groove is cut between the magnets in order to keep a gap between the copper plate and the sputtering target.  This effectively is an efficiency increase to a current magnetron based sputtering machine. The ring enhances the magnetic field intensity and increases the temperature of the target material.",

        "Description": "When testing composite structures, it is important to understand the response of the structure to the load. Of significance is the formation of damage and growth of that damage leading to ultimate failure. Understanding how a structure fails allows for optimal designs for improved safety and performance for the part during its life cycle. Inspection methods are required to determine damage initiation and growth in advanced composite structures during loading. Past methods for in-situ inspection of composite structures during loading have involved acoustic emission, passive thermography, digital image correlation, and fiber optics techniques. However, each of these has critical limitations. The combination of thermal and acoustic emission (AE) nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques, by mapping the acoustic emission events onto the thermal imagery, provides a very sensitive measurement system for detecting damage formation and growth.",

        "Description": "The high water-to-biomass ratio characteristic of conventional algae cultivation systems requires large energy inputs for pumping and mixing the culture during cultivation, as well as for dewatering and harvesting the resultant biomass. In light of this challenge, the Surface-Adhering BioReactor (SABR) cultivates micro-organisms as densely packed biofilms rather than in suspension, leading to an approximately 100-fold reduction in the water-to-biomass ratio of the system. Moreover, the mechanism of nutrient delivery to the cells is completely passive, eliminating the need for a pump. This mechanism is also independent of gravitational and inertial forces, making it an ideal candidate for human life support in space. The SABR is ideally suited for cultivating shear-sensitive cells, which can be product-secreting candidates due to their potential lack of cell walls. It reduces the number of steps in the cascade of cultivation, harvesting, dewatering, and extraction, favorably impacting the energetic and economic sustainability.",

The result, often quoted as a pair of numbers like 20:20, lets us know if corrective lenses or refractive surgery can help us better perform tasks like reading or driving. This invention provides an automated system to estimate visual acuity based on objective measurements of the eye optics and wavefront aberrations (WA). WA are represented in a particular form known as the Zernike polynomials. The WFAMetric is an algorithm that converts the list of numbers into an estimate of the visual acuity of the patient.

If both the operator and the display are undergoing vibration, their respective motion patterns need not be in phase.

This can be done either by strobing the ambient illumination in the environment (e.g., if the operator is reading a reflective surface display), or by strobing the display itself (e.g., strobing the backlighting of an electronic display).",

At the time of the mission, PICA was a developmental material, with no previous flight heritage.  For missions with high heat flux, a lower overall mass can be obtained if the Thermal Protection System (TPS) composition changes from a carbon-based ablator at the heated surface to an insulator near the inner surface. This new process delivers a graded surface-densification application to PICA allowing for optimized performance and TPS weight reduction. The desired surface densification is adaptable in terms of density of the applied surface treatment and depth of the surface treatment.",

There are several standards for measuring data quality and voice quality over analog and digital networks, but there is no current standard measure of display motion blur. Motion blur is a significant defect of most current display technologies. Motion blur arises when the display presents individual frames that persist for significant fractions of a frame duration. When the eye smoothly tracks a moving image, the image is smeared across the retina during the frame duration. Although motion blur may be manifest in any moving image, one widely-used test pattern is a moving edge. This pattern gives rise to measurements of what is called moving-edge blur. A number of methods have been developed to measure moving edge blur, however, none of these metrics attempts to provide a perceptual measure of the amount of motion blur. The perceptual metric for motion blur called Visible Motion Blur (VMB) incorporates three effects: contrast, masking, and visual resolution.",

This necessitated the development of a higher-fidelity image generator system, based on emerging technologies, than systems currently available as a complete solution. This innovation resulted in a 150 mega-pixel synchronized, continuous display system driving real-time computer generated imagery at a 60-Hz refresh rate.",

        "Description": "A new NASA technology provides for automated sample handling and movement of coarse-grained powder or other solid materials to enable analysis by a robotic or totally automated computer system. Currently, many analytical instruments require a powder sample: to control the shape and/or volume of the specimen; to increase the surface area of the specimen; to increase the statistical representation of a specimen when samples are not homogeneous with regard to the characterized property; and/or to increase the statistical representation of the specimen spatial orientation when the properties being characterized are not equivalent in different viewing directions. Grinding the material down to an ideal grain size is sometimes impossible, and conditioning the sample for analysis is often time consuming and labor intensive. In the new approach described herein, the powder is handled as a fluid, using mechanical vibrations in conjunction with a driving force (gravity or gas flow) and requiring few or no moving parts. This invention is available for licensing from NASAs space program to benefit U.S. industry.",

Ames Research Center has developed an alternative approach to forming radiation-reflecting materials by using the ordered structures that are found in nature to make materials that can be used to reflect radiation called Biologically-Inspired Radiation-Reflecting Ablator (BIRRA).",

The need for low-cost and environmentally friendly processes for fabricating printable electronics and biosensor chips is rapidly growing.  This plasma-based fabrication involves aerosol-assisted room temperature printing in which an aerosol carrying  the desired material for deposition is introduced into a cold plasma jet operated at atmospheric pressure. The deposition is the result of the interaction of the aerosol containing the precursor material with the  atmospheric pressure plasma containing a primary gas.  Aerosol-assisted plasma deposition is a high throughput and facile process for printing and patterning that is easily scalable for industrial production. Multiple jets can be used for depositing different materials and the approach can be adapted to a variety of platforms and coating a variety of materials.",

The new gimbal mount provides a seat for the motor and controls the position of the thrusters that propel the CubeSat as it moves about  and/or changes orbits. This small-footprint device controls the rotation (360&#0176) and tilt (+/-12&#0176) of a directional system to a very high accuracy&#0151 0.02&#0176. It alleviates the need for more traditional directional control hardware, including magnetorquers and magnetometers. The gimbal controls larger masses for its size than other positioning systems. It has a low parts count (six) and can support up to 0.5 kg mass. NASA built a prototype and conducted several tests to prove its control and precision capabilities, and its ability to withstand vibration testing. Now NASA seeks companies to commercialize the gimbal.",

Additionally, the valve consists of only five parts with a few simple seals incorporated into a well protected design. The simple design allows for use in nominal or extremely high pressures and for the use of soft or hard metal seats; this valve design reduces downtime and maintenance costs, while increasing valve reliability and seat life.",

At cryogenic temperatures, valves grow and shrink, changing critical dimensions such as distance between the disc and seat. Ideally, valves would compensate. The inability of existing butterfly valves to do this triggered the innovative design of the Cryogenic Cam Butterfly Valve (CCBV). The CCBV is designed so that the disc rides on a cam shaft and is held rigid by a torsion spring, which provides both axial movement of the disc in addition to the standard 90 degree rotation of a standard butterfly valve. Because the valves disc can rotate and translate, it can hold a tighter seal, preventing leakage despite dimensional changes caused by changing operating temperatures. The novel concept enables functional advantages similar to a globe valve. The CCBV enables low leakage at both ambient and cryogenic temperatures. Compared to competing valves, it is a simpler design which results in reduced manufacturing and maintenance costs.",

The VARR valve provides two-way flow that is proportional to flow demand. As the pressure gradient builds on one side, the reed valve responds by opening an amount that is proportionate to the gradient, or demand, allowing bidirectional flow. Some mechanical and fluid systems that rely on the controlled flow of fluids between chambers will benefit from the new design. Compared to current fixed orifice devices, VARR may expand the performance envelope by offering a more continuous flow response in applications in which the pressure environment is constantly changing. Proportional two-way flow can enable a fine-tuned system response to pressure building on one side of the valve. In these changing gradient conditions, the reed valve is better than fixed-sized orifices, which are optimized for one flow condition and are likely to over- or under-restrict flow for all other flow gradients.",

        "Description": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) developed Ultrasonic Stir Welding (USW) to join large pieces of very high-strength metals such as titanium and Inconel. USW, a solid-state weld process, improves current thermal stir welding processes by adding high-power ultrasonic (HPU) energy at 20 kHz frequency. The addition of ultrasonic energy significantly reduces axial, frictional, and shear forces; increases travel rates; and reduces wear on the stir rod, which results in extended stir rod life. The USW process decouples the heating, stirring, and forging elements found in the friction stir welding process allowing for independent control of each process element and, ultimately, greater process control and repeatability. Because of the independent control of USW process elements, closed-loop temperature control can be integrated into the system so that a constant weld nugget temperature can be maintained during welding.",

In low pressure conditions of 100 psi or less, sealing issues often occur when a low cracking pressure is desired. Alternative check valves are unable to provide the required sealing stress on the valve seat.

This is done by etching a tiny cavity in phosphorous doped silicon, bordered by three electrodes; a source, a gate, and a drain. The source and drain are separated by 150 nanometer (nm), with the gate on top. Electrons are emitted from the source due to a voltage applied across it and the drain, while the gate controls the electron flow across the cavity. When the gap between the source and drain is of the order of 150nm the electrons do not collide. The mean free path of the electrons (the average length an electron can travel before hitting something) is more than 1micrometer (m). Advantages of the vacuum tube and transistor are combined here through nanofabrication. A photoresist ashing technique enables a nanogap separation of the emitter and the collector, thus allowing operation at less than 10V. This allows high frequency and power output while satisfying the metrics of lightness, cost, lifetime, and stability at harsh conditions. The operation voltage can be decreased comparable to modern semiconductor devices.",

During cruise, both speed and sweep angles could be adjusted accordingly. Before final approach, the wing would again be rotated to the perpendicular position in order to improve the aircraft's low-speed performance.

        "Description": "NASA has developed a new method of wing shaping using distributed propulsion that can revolutionize the design of aircraft. Distributed propulsion aeroelastic wing shaping is a new aircraft concept. Most commercial aircraft are still utilizing one gas-turbine engine per wing. By contrast, distributed propulsion envisions the use of multiple small electrically powered propulsion units distributed along the wings. By taking advantage of increased wing flexibility afforded by the use of light-weight materials such as composites, the aeroelastic deflection of a wing can be actively shaped in-flight for optimal aerodynamic efficiency by varying the amount of thrust generated by the propulsion units. By using distributed propulsion, the optimal wing shape can be used for other phases such as takeoff, landing, and in-flight maneuvers. In addition, distributed propulsion can be leveraged for yaw and roll controls, thus reducing the need for a full vertical tail size for weight savings. Thus, an entire aircraft design can be developed more creatively using distributed propulsion concepts for reduced fuel burn. Initial performance analysis indicates that this concept could achieve about 4% increase in lift-to-drag ratio.",

        "Description": "NASA has patented a design optimization method for optimal shapes for hypersonic vehicles with mid-range lift/drag ratios that enter or operate in planetary atmospheres, including Earth. The design method provides optimized aerodynamic properties (maximizing maneuverability and stability) and aero-thermodynamic properties.  The method provides automatic generation of geometry and analysis grids (meshes) rapidly created from a small set of parameters, which can be interpreted in a straightforward and intuitive manner. The vehicle shapes are known as Co-Optimized Blunt Re-Entry Aero (COBRA) geometries. A key advantage for design work is that this approach uses a parameterization that fully defines the vehicle shape without need for human intervention and is thus suitable for rapid automated optimization methods. The method automatically produces a Pareto optimized subset, from which human judgement can then be used to further explore this optimum set and down select to a particular vehicle concept based on trajectory, thermal protection sizing, structural sizing and final vehicle closure.",

The first concept is referred to as a variable camber continuous trailing edge flap or, alternatively, a variable camber continuous leading edge slat.

The second element is a new active wing-shaping control concept that is proposed in connection with the presently disclosed variable camber continuous trailing edge flap (or leading edge slat). The active wing-shaping control is designed to aeroelastically change a wing shape in-flight in order to achieve a desired wing shape for optimal drag reduction.",

While lowering drag overall, some additional drag is induced at the root of a winglet.  NASA Ames has developed a novel patent-pending technology that employs the injection of air at the trailing edge of a winglet to further reduce drag resulting in fuel savings in the operation of the aircraft.  This technology can be applied to aircraft (large or small) that currently uses winglets, and more particularly, to wing-tip devices with the addition of pores for reducing vortex drag.",

As with 1-3U CubeSats, an ejector system was needed for the 6U CubeSat, but it had yet to be developed. The ejector system interfaces to the launch vehicle and functions to protect the primary payload from the nanosatellite, constrain the nanosatellite during launch, and perform a guided ejection afterwards. The standard 1-3U CubeSat ejector's method (Poly Picosat Orbital Deployer (P-POD)) for the constraint and guided ejection functions was found to be inadequate for NASA mission needs. Therefore, an ejector system was designed to provide the nanosatellite with a more secure constraint interface during launch and an efficient guided ejection, while permitting a less restrictive inner volume.

The ideal propulsion system for small satellites is one that balances reliability, high performance, scalability, contamination issues, low pressure operation, safe propellant containment, low cost, and simple design in order to meet performance requirements. Previous attempts to utilize vacuum arc technology for spacecraft propulsion has had several issues. Currently, many vacuum arc thrusters lack a sufficient operational lifetime because of their lack of propellant feed systems. Additionally, many thrusters have uneven erosion over the cathode face, thus changing the thruster characteristics and plume direction during operation. Uneven erosion also creates macroparticles that decrease thrust. Current thrusters lack a collimated plasma plume. Lack of collimation decreases the thrust and can cause contamination issues such as resetting electronics components or coating the satellite. The Ion Control System is a micro propulsion system that is low cost, high performing, flight proven, reliable, easily configurable, and scalable.",

Simple hinged flaps are preferable high-lift devices for low-drag cruise performance, but they are vulnerable to flow separation at high flap deflections for both trailing edge and leading edge applications.

Avian wing geometry inspired the concept of a static extended trailing edge (SETE), as shown in Figure 1, where the main airfoil is extended at the trailing edge by attaching a flexible polymer membrane with suitable length and rigidity.

        "Description": "Community noise has been identified as a major barrier to entry-into-service of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and urban air mobility (UAM) platforms.  For these applications, distributed electric propulsion (DEP) systems are becoming increasingly popular because of their ability to distribute propulsors in many locations on the vehicle.  New small/medium UAV's and UAM's, and thin/short haul aircraft concepts and demonstrators exploit DEP systems for different purposes.  However, given the problem of community noise, NASA engineers have modified the vehicle noise directivity pattern by controlling the relative angular positions of the propulsors blades, in order to direct noise away from sensitive areas.",

It can be used in combination with many of the existing techniques for passive and active laminar flow control, but is particularly well-suited for a supersonic natural laminar flow design by virtue of avoiding the space, weight, system complexity, and maintenance penalties associated with suction based laminar flow control.",

Groups of rotors operating at the same rotation rate with an appropriate phase offset can be used to reduce the tonal noise of the aircraft when there are multiple rotors on each side of the aircraft.\n\nReducing tonal noise, depending on the aircraft design, can effectively reduce the total noise output for a given flight scenario. Aircraft can be designed with this technology to prioritize quieter take-off and landing, or can be designed for decreased noise in cruise. Existing designs may benefit from this technology as well, but what type of benefits can be gained depend on the design of the aircraft.\n\nUsing this method, multiple rotors can be significantly quieter than a single rotor, without sacrificing thrust.",

The primary challenge with supersonic flight remains the mitigation of the sonic boom to levels that will be acceptable to humans on the ground. As industry progresses towards realizing a commercial supersonic aircraft, the push from regulators to reduce noise levels has intensified. To meet this need, sBOOMTraj was developed to predict and mitigate sonic boom levels without resorting to less accurate shock theory or other numerical post-processing techniques. The software incorporates atmospheric and terrestrial effects, as well as functionality to handle aircraft trajectories and maneuvers. SBOOMTraj has potential applications in the design and development of next generation supersonic aircraft, and may also enable pilots and operators of such aircraft to plan flight paths to reduce their noise footprints.",

        "Description": "Goddard Space Flight Center has developed a portfolio of molecular adsorber coatings (MAC) to mitigate issues posed by volatile organic compounds (VOC). Many materials contain gasses that are trapped on or within the surface that, when in vacuum, will escape the host material over time - a process known as outgassing. The extent of outgassing is a function of the material, temperature, and the vacuum level present. To address outgassing issues in spacecraft, NASA has historically used zeolite based molecular adsorbers in spacecraft and instruments to collect and retain outgassed molecular effluent emanating from potting compounds, epoxies, tapes, lubricants, and other spacecraft materials, protecting critical, contamination sensitive, surfaces. Uncontrolled, molecular contamination can cause significant degradation of instrument performance, thermal control properties, solar array efficiency, optical surfaces, laser systems, detectors, cryogenic instruments, and high powered electronics. In an effort to simplify previously flown complex zeolite coated cordierite molecular adsorber puck systems, such as those flown on Hubble Space Telescope (HST), a portfolio of easily produced and applied molecular adsorber coatings have been developed.",

Important system-level benefits are enabled by improved performance data from sensor circuitry mounted within very hot gas turbine flows or the primary coolant loop of a nuclear reactor, for example. Often, tiny (microvolt) signals from sensors require conditioning by high-temperature electrical components to filter, amplify and convert  to levels suitable for digitization and \"smart\" system control. Op amps are a critical component for signal amplification. With the new threshold voltage correction scheme, the signal amplification of all op amps, at any position on the SiC wafer, is the same, extending reliable signal conditioning well beyond the current temperature limits of conventional silicon integrated circuits allowing useful chips to be produced across the entire SiC wafer surface.",

The enhanced stability of these components will enable important improvements in sensing, control, and operation of harsh environment systems, by providing analog and digital circuit functionality directly where it is needed.

Prior to this innovation, the plasma would erode the ceramic chamber of the HET in just over a year of operation. Glenn's breakthrough technology prolongs this operational lifetime through two related innovations. The first is an innovative magnetic field configuration that provides magnetic shielding to eliminate interactions between the high energy xenon plasma produced by the HET and the ceramic chamber that contains it. The second is a means of replacing eroded discharge channel material via a channel wall replacement mechanism.

NASA uses overhead and mobile cranes for assembly of load lines employed in full-scale testing of its Space Launch System (SLS), a super-heavy-lift launch vehicle for deep space human space exploration. Structural testing of the SLS requires precision placement of heavy objects with soft contact during mating connections, which proved to be problematic with the relatively coarse control available with motor-driven overhead cranes and existing rigging devices.

The use of a magnetically controlled relief valve as opposed to a spring-based relief valve enables quick-open on/off relief operation when overpressure is reached. This is due to the rapid decay of the magnetic field as the fluid medium pushes the valve poppet to an open position. Spring-based relief valves require increasing pressure and force to continually compress the spring and open the relief valve. This requirement greatly complicates the design of a system relief mechanism. A magnetic relief valve reduces these design complexities by eliminating the spring.\n\nThe relief valve mechanism is fully sealed and is isolated from the flow path of the fluid/gas media. This may lead to lower maintenance than is currently required for pressure relief valves. Existing relief valve springs are exposed to corrosive environmental factors and system fluids. This environmental exposure leads to corrosion that can cause changes in the cracking pressure.",

Glenn's NiTi-Hf ball bearings are superior to any previously used alloy or steel.

For example, the new system eliminates the need for large blowers and compressors that force air at high velocities through adsorption-based systems using solid sorbents.",

In response to an external stimulus such as a temperature change or an electric field, the thermosetting material changes shape, but then returns\nto its original form once conditions return to normal. Through a precise combination of monomers, conductive fillers, and elastic layers, the NASA polymer matrix can be triggered by two effects--Joule heating and dielectric loss--to increase the response. The new material remedies the limitations\nof other SMPs currently on the market--namely the slow stimulant response times, the strength inconsistencies, and the use of toxic epoxies that may complicate manufacturing.\nNASA has developed prototypes and now seeks a partner\nto license the technology for commercial applications.",

Methods currently available to clean AM parts have significant drawbacks. Immersive cleaning using solvents or solutions can cause powder clumping. Forms of blasting (e.g., wet, bead, hydro, bristle, vacuum, etc.) work on line-of-site surfaces but are ineffective for recessed cavities. Such cleaning is typically manual, highly time consuming, and requires careful use of personal protective equipment to avoid powder inhalation. Thus, the AM market would benefit from a more automated, rapid, and effective method for cleaning complex parts.",

Testing with the IFR tool has shown a significant reduction in the number of defects found in SR-FSW welds, and the tool allows significantly longer SR-FSW welds to be performed. Utilizing the IFR Tool can reduce SR-FSW welding costs by reducing scrap/rework rates, reducing the number of pin tools required per unit weld length, and reducing the time spent changing out SR-FSW pin tools per unit weld length. Along with improving the cost-effectiveness of existing SR-FSW applications, the IFR Tool may also further expand the applications for which SR-FSW is a commercially viable solution.",

Centerbody diffuser designs provide an improvement by reducing the maximum Mach number of the core flow, but also increase the number of oblique shocks in the system by introducing multiple turns into the system. \n\nA new type of spike diffuser recently developed by NASA Stennis Space Center is able to provide approximately double the pumping performance of second-throat diffusers via Pareto-efficient reduction of both core Mach number and flow deflection. This enables substantially lower vacuum pressures to be achieved for a given feed pressure/mass flow via the use of higher-expansion-ratio driving nozzles.

It combines good resolution with small size and potentially reduced manufacturing costs. The ultra-compact integration of the spectrometer is enabled by the use of an optimized Fresnel grating. Since Fresnel imaging works as valid focal points of spectrum within the short optical\ndistance, the shorter optical path length required (compared to a traditional Fraunhofer lens) enables the small size. Further, the evolution to a differentially linear Fresnel lens (instead of circular Fresnel) avoids the need for aperture slit driver electronics and moving parts, and simplifies manufacturing. The linear Fresnel gratings lend themselves to mass production via plastic injection molding or nano-imprint lithography.

These high-lift devices, such as Fowler flaps, are complex, heavy, and have high part counts. Fowler flap mechanisms also protrude externally under the wings, requiring external fairings, which increase cruise drag. Simple-hinged flaps are less complex, and an ideal choice for low-drag cruise efficiency. However, simple-hinged flaps require high flap deflections to achieve lift comparable to Fowler flaps. These flap deflections cause severe  adverse pressure gradients, which generate flow separation that is difficult to control.\n\nIn response to these challenges, NASA developed the High Efficiency Low Power (HELP) active flow control (AFC) system. This simple, elegant invention can control flow separation resulting from the high flap deflections required by simple-hinged flap systems  making such flaps a viable option for aircraft designers.  Aircraft with simple-hinged flap systems will achieve reduced cruise drag, thereby increased fuel efficiency.",
