Often undetectable with current radar, ice crystals in convective storm cells can produce a phenomenon referred to as \\\\\\\"Ice Crystal Icing,\\\\\\\" in which ice accumulates, or accretes, in turbofan engines. Ice-crystal accretion can cause serious <span class=\\\\\\\"highlight\\\\\\\">engine<\\/span> operational problems and sometimes even catastrophic <span class=\\\\\\\"highlight\\\\\\\">engine<\\/span> failures. Using a combination of sensors, <span class=\\\\\\\"highlight\\\\\\\">engine<\\/span> system modeling, and compressor flow analysis code, Glenn's innovation performs real-time analysis to determine the potential of ice accretion. This analysis allows pilots to avoid potential icing while using a more direct route than would otherwise be possible.

In addition, these complex mechanical high-lift systems (e.g., Fowler flap mechanisms) often protrude externally under the wings, resulting in increased cruise drag. Simple hinged flaps are preferable high-lift devices for low-drag cruise performance, but they are vulnerable to flow separation at high flap deflections for both trailing edge and leading edge applications.  This innovation achieves higher flap deflections without flow separation while minimizing the pneumatic power requirement of AFC.\\\",\\\"LAR-TOPS-117\\\",\\\"aerospace\\\",\\\"\\\",\\\"\\\",\\\"\\\",\\\"LARC\\\",\\\"https:\\/\\/technology.nasa.gov\\/t2media\\/tops\\/img\\/LAR-TOPS-117\\/front image.jpg\\\",\\\"\\\",7.8119187],[\\\"5ece2cb540205c0c2819e334\\\",\\\"MFS-TOPS-103\\\",\\\"Defect-Free Paraffin Fuel Manufacturing\\\",\\\"Innovators at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) developed a novel paraffin-based fuel and manufacturing process for use in hybrid rocket engines for the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV).  The fuel has a suitable regression rate and additives for additional strength and survivability.  The process addresses the manufacturing issues with larger-diameter paraffin fuel grains.  The manufacturing process employs a novel cooling protocol to result in intact monolithic fuel grains at scale for use in propulsion systems with hybrid rocket engines. Engineers are investigating the use of this paraffin-based fuel specifically for MAV because the fuel has a wider storage temperature range than other propellants.  The paraffin based fuel survives in low temperatures (-100 C), freeing up energy for other vehicle or mission purposes.  Challenges arose with manufacturing these fuel grains due to the &#126;15&#37;  volume liquid to solid phase change, different density ingredients and inherent brittle nature of paraffin wax. Prior manufacturing efforts lead to problems with cracked, unusable fuel grains, and the inability to produce at the scale needed for use in propulsion systems.\\\",\\\"MFS-TOPS-103\\\",\\\"propulsion\\\",\\\"\\\",\\\"\\\",\\\"\\\",\\\"MSFC\\\",\\\"https:\\/\\/technology.nasa.gov\\/t2media\\/tops\\/img\\/MFS-TOPS-103\\/front__1_-convert.jpg\\\",\\\"\\\",7.8044524],[\\\"59fa05cb9600022b4dea2185\\\",\\\"LAR-TOPS-29\\\",\\\"Magnetic Field Response Measurement Acquisition System\\\",\\\"NASAs Langley Research Center researchers have developed a measurement acquisition system that uses magnetic fields to provide power to sensors and to acquire physical property measurements from them.

Winner of the prestigious R&D 100 award, this technology has been demonstrated with a leading aircraft landing gear manufacturer to wirelessly measure the fluid levels in landing gear shock struts.

This feature gives the sensor a smaller circuit footprint to enable a smaller, flexible, and easy to fabricate sensor package.

It combines good resolution with small size and potentially reduced manufacturing costs. The ultra-compact integration of the spectrometer is enabled by the use of an optimized Fresnel grating. Since Fresnel imaging works as valid focal points of spectrum within the short optical\\\\ndistance, the shorter optical path length required (compared to a traditional Fraunhofer lens) enables the small size. Further, the evolution to a differentially linear Fresnel lens (instead of circular Fresnel) avoids the need for aperture slit driver electronics and moving parts, and simplifies manufacturing. The linear Fresnel gratings lend themselves to mass production via plastic injection molding or nano-imprint lithography.

Severe impairments in dynamic visual function can stem from a large number of causes, including: stroke, traumatic brain injury, autism, Alzheimers disease, schizophrenia, degenerative retinal disease, drug toxicity, aging, and spaceflight-induced visual impairment.  To assess various aspects of dynamic visual function including peripheral attention, peripheral spatial localization, perceptual motion processing, and oculomotor responsiveness, we developed a simple fifteen-minute clinical test that measures and computes ten eye-movement-based, i.e., oculometric, measures.  Our oculometric tool may be useful to clinicians to localize affected brain regions following trauma, degenerative disease, or aging, to characterize and quantify clinical deficits, to monitor recovery of function after injury, and to detect altered or impaired visual performance at sub-clinical levels.  This sensitive assessment tool has immediate applicability as a screening tool by comparing the oculometric measures of an individual to a normal baseline population, or from the same individual before and after exposure to a potentially-traumatic event (e.g., a boxing match, football game, combat tour, space mission), or on an ongoing basis to monitor performance as it returns to baseline following injury.  Applications of our oculometric tool include screening: patients for deficits in visual function; pilot candidates based upon inherent dynamic visual capabilities; patients, players, or soldiers for recovery by periodic reassessment following injury;  automobile drivers as they age; and astronaut visual status before and after a mission.\\\",\\\"researchCenter\\\":\\\"ARC\\\"},{\\\"sysId\\\":2,\\\"Id\\\":\\\"57a06e5b960002877a676459\\\",\\\"category\\\":\\\"instrumentation\\\",\\\"name\\\":\\\"NPO-49553-3\\\",\\\"patentName\\\":\\\"Biblade sampler\\\",\\\"Description\\\":\\\"A BiBlade sampler may include a first blade and a second blade in a     retracted position.
