        "d3": "An eye movement-based methodology and assessment tool may be used to     quantify many aspects of human dynamic visual processing using a     relatively simple and short oculomotor task, noninvasive video-based eye     tracking, and validated oculometric analysis techniques. By examining the     eye movement responses to a task including a radially-organized     appropriately randomized sequence of Rashbass-like step-ramp     pursuit-tracking trials, distinct performance measurements may be     generated that may be associated with, for example, pursuit initiation     (e.g., latency and open-loop pursuit acceleration), steady-state tracking     (e.g., gain, catch-up saccade amplitude, and the proportion of the     steady-state response consisting of smooth movement), direction tuning     (e.g., oblique effect amplitude, horizontal-vertical asymmetry, and     direction noise), and speed tuning (e.g., speed responsiveness and     noise). This quantitative approach may provide fast and results (e.g., a     multi-dimensional set of oculometrics and a single scalar impairment     index) that can be interpreted by one without a high degree of scientific     sophistication or extensive training.",
